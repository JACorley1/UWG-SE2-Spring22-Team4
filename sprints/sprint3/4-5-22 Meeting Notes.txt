- Exercise duplication
	> use sets if duplicated

		> low: 10, mod: 15, high: 20
		> volume split evenly across days selected
	
- Progess tracking?
	> Time to complete workout
	> Reps performed (max effort during workout)
	> Body weight changes
	
- Workout generation?
	> Reps/set specification
		
- Show day's workout immediately on login
	> Also show current day as different from others in weekly view
	> Add notes input to daily workout view
		- Should be different based on type of workout (reps/time)
		- Enter weight on each day with graph showing overall progress
	
- System refactoring
	> Change workout generation to incorporate more-smart programming (muscles on different days)
	
- Main focuses
	> User stats tracking (body weight, avg. reps per day)
	> Refactor UI - stats page, daily view for user input, reps per exercise
	> Refactor workout generation
